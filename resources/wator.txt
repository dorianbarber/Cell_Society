Wa-Tor is usually implemented as a two-dimensional 
grid with three colours, one for fish, one for 
sharks and one for empty water. If a creature 
moves past the edge of the grid, it reappears 
on the opposite side. The sharks are predatory 
and eat the fish. Both sharks and fish live, 
move, reproduce and die in Wa-Tor according 
to the simple rules
