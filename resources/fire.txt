If a small area of a forest catches fire (red cells), 
then that fire spreads to a neighboring cell (green cells for trees) with some probability determined by 
outside factors (default of 70%). A neighboring
cell is one directly North, East, South,
or West of the cell. Once a cell has been 
on fire for a round, it is burned out (grey)
and can not be re-lit.
