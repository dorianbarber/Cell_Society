This model shows how demographic groups
self-segregate by moving within their 
communities. White cells indicate
uninhabited areas, while blue and
red cells indicate two different demographic
groups. When a blue or red cell is surrounded
by unacceptable numbers of the other group,
it moves randomly to an uninhabited area.
