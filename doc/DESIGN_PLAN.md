CELL SOCIETY TEAM 09
===================

### Introduction
The problem our team is trying to solve is writing a program that will animate any 2D grid cellular automata simulation. Cellular automata are simulation based on some model that consists of grid cells that are in one of a finite number of states. Each cell within the simulation will have its neighbors defined relative to the specific cell. Over time a fixed rule is applied to the simulation in which will determine new states for each relevant cell. Some examples of cellular automata are Schelling's model of segregation and Wa-Tor World model of predator-prey relationships. The goal of this project is to be able to animate any cellular automata simulation given. 

The primary design goal of the project is to develop a set of classes that can adapt to any different cellular automata simulation. The flexibility will come into play when the cellular automata simulation is defined. Once a certain simulation is defined the built classes will be able to adapt to its specifications: the number of states and what those states are, what is to be considered within a cell's neighborhood, and the rule that the simulation will follow. The user will be closed to modifying code that depends on the algorithm. The only available section of code that will be open to extension is the addition of a new model or new behaviors of existing modules. Through following the open-closed principle, the program will resist changes that result in a cascading effect to the any dependent modules. One effective approach that we will exercise as a team is abstraction. By following this principle of object oriented design, we can create abstractions that are fixed and represent a set of possible behaviors. Since the abstraction is fixed, child modules are closed for modification. The behavior, however, can be extended by creating new derivatives of the abstraction. Executing the open-closed principle primarily through abstraction and strategic closure our program will reach a state of reusability and maintainablilty.
